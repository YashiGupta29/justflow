"What Age Do People Get Their First Periods?", Most girls get their first periods between the ages of 11 and 14, but you might be younger or older than that when you get yours - there's no right age to get it. Ask your mother when she got her first period. It's a good indication of when yours might come.

"What are the Signs That My Period is Coming?",The signs are a little different for everyone, and as you get older, you'll get really good at reading your body. Some things to look for, though, are sore breasts, back pain, cranky moods, constipation, a bloated belly, depression, a big appetite and a breakout of a couple zits. You won't experience all of these symptoms before your period every month, but you might experience some.
